# Dotfiles
 
Some dot files to make my life easier. Feel free to copy/fork

# How to use
1. clone the whole repo (prefferably into ~/dotfiles)
'git clone https://github.com/langtianlang/dotfiles.git'

1. run the setup script (Note: this will install zsh if your machine doesnt have it)
'cd dotfiles'
'chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh'
